# Audio2Audio_translation

This repository contains the code for the automatic audio2audio translation. We use whisper for the transcription, BART for thranslation, and speechTT5 for audio playback generation. 

This is an early version of the code, a html/css ui and fast api is provided with the code. 

## Futur improvements
1. Real time audio processing (double buffering)
2. Voice cloning
3. chrome extension?
